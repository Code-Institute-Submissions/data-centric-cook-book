i used the page variable from flask paginate to redirect urls back to the pages the came from. 

to create my like button i utilized the $inc pymongo trick to get my counts and left as is.
to not over complicate my project i will stick to my increment feature only. 

To have access to crude activity users will have to add a user name to login. The edit and delete buttons will be deactivated 



since the scope of the project laid very little emphasies on front-end i have 
limited my screen tests to iphone6/6+/7/7+/8/8+,Galaxy s5 and desktops.
